# Stock Market Insight Dashboard Documentation

## Overview
This documentation outlines the steps taken to develop the Stock Market Insight Dashboard application using React and Vite. It includes the setup, issues encountered, and resolutions.

## Steps Taken

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Created a new React application using Vite.
   - Set up the project structure with directories for components, pages, and services.

2. **Component Development**:
   - Developed the following components:
     - **Navbar**: Navigation links to different pages.
     - **Footer**: Basic footer with copyright information.
     - **Dashboard**: Displays stock data fetched from an API.
     - **Home**: Welcome page with introductory text.
     - **BlankPage**: Placeholder page.

3. **Routing**:
   - Implemented routing using `react-router-dom` in `App.jsx`.
   - Defined routes for Home, Dashboard, and BlankPage.

4. **Data Fetching**:
   - Created a service to fetch stock data from the Finnhub API.
   - Implemented error handling in the Dashboard component to manage API call failures.

5. **Issues Encountered**:
   - **Blank White Page**: Initially, the application displayed a blank page due to routing and component export issues.
     - Resolved by ensuring correct imports and exports in components.
   - **Nested Router Error**: Encountered an error about rendering a `<Router>` inside another `<Router>`.
     - Resolved by removing the nested `Router` in `App.jsx`.
   - **Export Errors**: Errors related to components not providing default exports.
     - Resolved by ensuring all components were correctly exported.

6. **Final Testing**:
   - Verified that all components rendered correctly and that the application functioned as intended.
   - Ensured that error messages were displayed appropriately when stock data could not be fetched.

## Conclusion
The Stock Market Insight Dashboard is now fully functional, with proper routing, data fetching, and error handling. The application is ready for further enhancements or deployment.
